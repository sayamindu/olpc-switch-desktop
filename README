olpc-switch-desktop is a collection of utilities for switching between
desktop environments.

It consists of:
 1. A sugar control panel extension which allows the user to switch to GNOME
 2. A GNOME program which allows the user to switch to Sugar

The change is made through the simple scheme of writing the preferred desktop
environment at /home/olpc/.olpc-default-desktop (a simple text file containing
either "gnome" or "sugar"). It is expected that this file will be parsed
(e.g. in an xsession script) during X startup to decide which environment to
launch.
